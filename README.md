# Investigating-the-Appeal-of-Right-Wing-Politics-using-LDA-Topic-Modelling
Recent years have seen right-wing movements gaining traction, particularly in the West. Generally, right-wing politics is associated with nationalism, populism and protectionism. In other words, countries are renouncing the previously-held consensus on the merits of free trade, freedom of mobility and globalisation.  In this project, I attempt to investigate the appeal of right-wing politics. I will perform computational text analysis and unsupervised machine learning (LDA topic modeling) on opinion editorials and transcripts of speeches / interviews by right-wing leaders. Specifically, I have chosen 3 key events to study: the election of Donald Trump, Brexit and the surprise victory of Scott Morrison's conservative government in Australiaâ€™s federal election.  This project focuses on the reader response mode of literary criticism. The objective is to investigate how language use or the construction of narratives can affect audience response and therefore affect voting patterns.
