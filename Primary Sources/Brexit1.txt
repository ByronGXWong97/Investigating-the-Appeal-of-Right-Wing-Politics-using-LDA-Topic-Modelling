.

Hi folks. Here's the text of a speech I delivered today ahead of the close of nominations for the leadership of the Conservative Party, an election I have decided not to contest:

Last week the people of this country voted to take a new path and a new direction for Britain in a decision that I passionately support

and it is vital now to see this moment for what it is

not as a time to quail

not as a crisis

not as an excuse for wobbling or self-doubt

but as a moment of hope and ambition for Britain

a time not to fight against the tide of history

but to take that tide at the flood and sail on to fortune

This is our chance

This is our chance to build a Britain not just with a dynamic free market economy

but an economy where everyone benefits from that success

because as someone who has campaigned across the country and spoken to thousands of people

I can tell you there are too many who have not seen their wages rise for years

and in many cases have seen them fall

and who cannot understand how it is that the pay packets of FTSE-100 chief executives are now 150 times the average of their companies

and I am no communist

and as my time at city hall shows I am a tax-cutting Conservative

but I want a capitalism that is fairer

to these forgotten people

where we invest in the potential of every young person so that they have the skills and the confidence to take advantage of what this country has to offer

This is our chance to learn the lessons of that referendum campaign

and as one nation conservatives to speak up for those forgotten people

to give them the ladder up which they can climb

and to draw them back into the great Conservative coalition to which they once belonged

This is our chance to restore Britain’s standing as an independent, sovereign and self-governing nation

making our own trade policy

striking deals with the growth economies of the world

and I can tell you that just in the last few days I have already heard of overtures from

Australia, New Zealand, India, Malaysia and Singapore

and the good news for the Americans is that they will be at the front of the queue

and of course it is our chance to relaunch our commitment to Europe

to peace and stability on the continent – by giving leadership on defence cooperation, and counter-terrorism, and intelligence-sharing

and all that makes our continent safer

This is our chance to assert our values

to tell the world again what kind of country Britain is

where we value everyone equally

no matter where you were born, or when you came to this country or what religion you practise you are part of our great British family

and we celebrate the contribution made by people who have come to this country to make it better and richer

whether it is quants in the city of London or anaesthetists in the NHS

a country where every person regardless of their sexuality can get married and find fulfilment

- a freedom that must rank as one of the finest of David Cameron’s many fine achievements

This is our chance to unite our party around those values and at the same time to

unite our country

unite our society

and it is vital now to bring together everybody who campaigned so hard both for the remain and the leave sides

and I want to see the most talented and capable men and women in our party uniting to take our country forward

and when I think of the progress that I want Britain to make I cannot help think of how London has been transformed in the last few decades from relative stagnation to the most dynamic urban economy in Europe

I am immensely proud of what my team achieved at City Hall over the last 8 years

in which we did everything we could to break down the barriers that restrain the poorest in society

and to fuel the engines of social mobility

We brought down crime by almost 20 per cent, the murder rate down by half, bus crime down by 50 per cent

we cut deaths by fire by 50 per cent and brought down road traffic accidents to the lowest ever level

and when you think how crime and fire and road accidents disproportionately affect the poorest I believe you can see those reductions as a victory for social justice

We championed transport – the great equaliser and mobiliser

moving millions to take advantage of the greatest wealth-creating zone in the whole of Europe

and also liberating the development of hitherto inaccessible brownfield sites

so that we were able to build a record number of affordable homes

more than 100,000

to regenerate huge parts of east London

- go to the Olympic park and you will see the astonishing physical legacy from our games of 2012

and I am proud to say that when I left office last month there were 44,000 sites in this city under construction

more than at any time in the history of London

and we did everything we could to invest in our human capital

helping London’s superb schools and teaching with our excellence funds

creating more than 200k apprenticeships

and putting tens of millions of pounds into the pockets of the hardest-working families by championing the London Living Wage

and I am proud to say that not only is everyone living longer – 18 months for men and women

but the biggest gains in life expectancy have been made by those on the lowest incomes

When I became mayor London had 4 of the six poorest boroughs in the UK

there are now no London boroughs among the 20 most deprived in this country

it is time for us to invest in the infrastructure and to pursue the fiscal devolution agenda to ensure that London’s success is replicated – as it increasingly is – in the towns and cities across the UK

and I will not pretend that everything has always been rosy

Things are sometimes tough, even in the greatest city on earth

I have led our capital through riots and blizzards and strikes and terrorist attack

and every time we have bounced back and gone from strength to strength

I treasure the cover of Time Magazine from eight years ago, which had a picture of various famous London buildings being engulfed by the waves

London sinking, was the headline

Well, look at our capital today – still the number one financial centre

the greatest tech hub in this hemisphere

and the number one tourist destination on earth – with more people visiting the British Museum than the whole of Belgium

The prophets of doom were wrong then and they are wrong now

because London and the whole UK will flourish mightily outside the EU

since it is manifestly in the economic interests of our friends and partners to agree a deal

that involves mutual and universal access to our markets, with no tariffs and no quotas

while we remove ourselves from the EU legal order and the supremacy of the European Court

and take back control of our immigration policy with a points-based system that is fairer to all the talented people who want to come here

whether they are from the 7 per cent of the world that is in the EU or the 93 per cent who do not

because this is our chance to think globally again

to lift our eyes to the horizon

to bring our unique British voice and values – powerful, humane, progressive – to the great global forums without being elbowed aside by a supranational body

and instead of being afflicted by nerves let us seize this chance and make this our moment to stand tall in the world

That is the agenda for the next PM of this country

but I must tell you my friends – you who have faithfully waited for the punchline of this speech - that having consulted my colleagues I have concluded this person will not be me

my role will be to give every possible support to the next administration

to make sure that we properly fulfil the mandate of the people at the referendum

and to champion the agenda I believe in

to stick up for the forgotten people of this country

and so I believe that if we invest in our children and improve their life chances

if we continue to fuel the engines of social mobility

if we build on the great reforming legacy of David Cameron

if we invest in our infrastructure

and if we follow a sensible moderate one nation Conservative approach that is simultaneously tax-cutting and pro-enterprise

then I believe this country can be better and more wonderful and, yes, greater than ever

I want to thank my colleagues in parliament, my team and everyone who has supported our vision of a better Britain
